# USA Baby Names Analyzer

This is a shiny app with data taken from the kaggle dataset (USA Baby Names)[https://www.kaggle.com/datagov/usa-names/data]. I downloaded the zip file which has comma separated text files and loaded them into a dataframe to save as a csv. See data-cleaning.R. The data is from (ssa.gov)[http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html].
